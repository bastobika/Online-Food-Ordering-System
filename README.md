# Online-Food-Ordering-System
Developed an online food ordering system which can be used by two categories of users :

1. Customers :
  a. Can order food from one restaurant at a time.
  b. The total bill of the order will be calculated and the order would be placed. (No billing method has been added) 
  c. Customers can leave a rating for all the food items they have ordered as well as the entire restaurant once the order is completed.
  
2. Caterers :
  a. Can add food items and their prices under their name once they have been approved by the admin.
  b. Can update the status of an order when it has been delivered.
  c. Can keep track of all orders they have received.

Alsp, there is an admin who can approve the Caterers, view all orders in case of any discrepencies.
